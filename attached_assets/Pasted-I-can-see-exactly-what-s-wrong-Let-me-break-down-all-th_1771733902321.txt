I can see exactly what's wrong. Let me break down all the issues clearly so you can give precise instructions to fix everything:

---

## ❌ PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED FROM YOUR SCREENSHOTS

**1. FONTS** — Way too heavy/bold. H1 looks like a billboard. Needs to be lighter, more refined, professional weight (600 not 900).

**2. HERO RIGHT SIDE** — The dashboard/graph looks cheap, amateurish. No real design, no depth, no professionalism. Needs complete redesign.

**3. LOGOS IN MARQUEE** — Just plain text moving. No actual logo styling, no icons, no visual weight. Looks like a dev placeholder.

**4. SECTIONS BELOW HERO** — Completely empty/white. No content, no design, nothing rendered below the fold.

**5. NO RESPONSIVE UI/UX** — Broken layout, not tested on any screen size.

**6. NO REAL ANIMATIONS** — Just basic movement, no entrance effects, no scroll triggers, no life.

> **"The current website has major issues. Fix ALL of the following completely:**
>
> **1. TYPOGRAPHY FIX:**
> Change H1 font-weight from 900/black to 600–700 max. Use `font-weight: 700` for H1, `600` for H2, `400–500` for body. Font size H1 should be `clamp(42px, 5vw, 72px)` — not oversized. Use Syne for headings, DM Sans for body. Text should look elegant and premium, NOT like a poster.
>
> **2. HERO RIGHT SIDE — COMPLETE REDESIGN:**
> Remove the current cheap graph card. Replace with a proper floating glassmorphism analytics dashboard panel. It must contain:
> - A top header: "Live Performance Dashboard" with a pulsing green "● LIVE" dot
> - An SVG animated growth curve chart (smooth curved line, gradient fill below it, animated drawing effect on load)
> - Three metric tiles below the chart: "Visitors 12,847 +24%↑" | "Conversions 1,284 +18%↑" | "Revenue $48.2K +32%↑" — each with a green upward arrow and green percentage
> - A floating mini card (top-right, bobbing animation): "⭐ 4.9 Google Rating" with 5 gold stars
> - A floating mini card (bottom-left, delayed bob): "🎯 Leads Generated: 1,284" with a small sparkline bar
> - Card style: white background, `border: 1px solid rgba(107,143,212,0.2)`, `box-shadow: 0 20px 60px rgba(139,92,246,0.15)`, `border-radius: 20px`, `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`
> - All cards float with CSS animation: `@keyframes float { 0%,100%{transform:translateY(0)} 50%{transform:translateY(-10px)} }` with different durations (3s, 4s, 5s) so they move independently
>
> **3. MARQUEE / PARTNER LOGOS FIX:**
> Don't just show plain moving text. Style each logo item as a pill/badge with: `background: rgba(107,143,212,0.08)`, `border: 1px solid rgba(107,143,212,0.2)`, `border-radius: 50px`, `padding: 10px 24px`, `font-weight: 600`, `color: #3A5FBF`. Add a relevant emoji or SVG icon before each name. Items: 🔍 Google Partner | 📘 Meta Business | 📊 SEMrush | 🔗 Ahrefs | 🟠 HubSpot | ⭐ Clutch | 🛒 Shopify | 📧 Mailchimp. Speed: 30s linear infinite. Pause on hover.
>
> **4. BUILD ALL MISSING SECTIONS — DO NOT LEAVE BLANK SPACE:**
> After the marquee, build ALL of these sections with full content and styling:
>
> - **About Section:** Split layout. Left: heading "We Are More Than An Agency" + 3 paragraphs about Infinite Rankers mission. Right: 2x2 animated stat grid (500+ Clients, $50M+ Revenue, 100+ Services, 98% Retention) — each stat counts up on scroll using IntersectionObserver.
>
> - **Services Section:** Heading "100+ Services, All Under One Roof". 3-column card grid (2-col tablet, 1-col mobile) with these 12 cards: SEO, PPC & Google Ads, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, Web Design, Email Marketing, Video Marketing, Reputation Management, CRO, Link Building, Influencer Marketing, Analytics & Reporting. Each card: icon (emoji or SVG) + title + 2-line description + "Learn More →" link. Hover: translateY(-8px) + purple glow shadow.
>
> - **Why Choose Us:** Left side bold text "Why 500+ Businesses Trust Infinite Rankers". Right side: 6 feature rows each with a checkmark icon, title, and one-line description. Features: Google Partner Certified | Revenue-First Approach | 100+ Proven Services | Dedicated Account Manager | Transparent Monthly Reports | Proven Lead Generation System.
>
> - **Results / Case Studies:** 3 cards. Each card: Industry tag (pill badge) + Business type + Challenge (1 line) + 3 result metrics with animated counters. Example: "Law Firm | +340% Organic Traffic | 3x More Leads | $120K Revenue Generated". Card style: white, gradient top border (blue to purple), hover lift.
>
> - **Process Section:** "How We Turn Clicks Into Customers". 4 horizontal steps (stack on mobile): 1. Free Audit & Strategy Call → 2. Custom Marketing Plan → 3. Execute & Optimize → 4. Report & Scale. Each step: circle number (gradient bg) + title + short desc. Animated connecting line between steps that draws on scroll.
>
> - **Industries Section:** Icon grid 4x3. Industries: Law Firms, Dentists, Restaurants, Real Estate, E-commerce, Medical, Contractors, Auto, Salons, Gyms, Hotels, Finance. Each: emoji icon + label. Hover: blue border + scale up.
>
> - **Testimonials:** Auto-sliding carousel (no library, pure JS). 3 cards visible on desktop, 1 on mobile. Each: quote text + client name + business type + star rating (5 gold stars). Auto-advance every 4s, pause on hover.
>
> - **CTA Banner:** Full-width section. Background: animated gradient blob (blue + purple). Headline: "Ready to Dominate Your Market?" + subtext + two buttons. Section has a grain noise overlay at 8% opacity.
>
> - **Footer:** 4-column layout. Logo + tagline + Google Partner badge | Company links | Services links | Contact placeholder ([PHONE], [EMAIL], [ADDRESS USA]) + social icons. Second row: "Also visit: infinitemarketstore.io" backlink. Bottom bar: copyright + Privacy Policy + Terms.
>
> **5. SCROLL ANIMATIONS — EVERY SECTION:**
> Use IntersectionObserver (no external library needed). Every section and card fades up on scroll: `opacity: 0; transform: translateY(30px)` → `opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0)` with `transition: 0.6s ease`. Stagger children with `transition-delay: 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s...`
>
> **6. CUSTOM CURSOR:**
> Remove old cursor. Build new one: outer ring 32px, `border: 1.5px solid #3A5FBF`, follows with lerp factor `0.13` using requestAnimationFrame. Inner dot 5px solid `#8B5CF6`, follows instantly. On hover links: ring scales to 52px + `background: rgba(58,95,191,0.1)`. On click: quick scale(0.75) bounce. DO NOT use setInterval — use rAF only.
>
> **7. NAVBAR:**
> On scroll past 80px: add `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` + `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` + `box-shadow: 0 1px 20px rgba(107,143,212,0.15)`. Hide on scroll down, show on scroll up (transform: translateY). Smooth 0.4s transition.
>
> **8. FULL RESPONSIVENESS:**
> Test and fix every breakpoint. Mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1280px. Use `clamp()` for all font sizes. Hero stacks to column on mobile. Dashboard right side scales to 85% on tablet, hides floating cards on mobile (show only main card). All grids go to 1 column on mobile. Buttons full-width on mobile."**
